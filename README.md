# Bitsgap Automated Trading Bots: Save 20% Annually, Connect 15+ Exchanges, 7-Day Free Trial

So you're sitting there, watching your crypto portfolio, refreshing the charts every five minutes like it's going to magically multiply itself. Here's the thing - while you're doing that, there's a whole world of automated trading bots working 24/7, catching opportunities you'd completely miss while sleeping or, you know, living your life.

That's where Bitsgap comes in. It's not some flashy new player trying to reinvent the wheel. This platform has been around since 2017, quietly helping over 800,000 traders automate their crypto strategies across multiple exchanges. Think of it as your tireless trading assistant that never needs coffee breaks.

## What Makes Bitsgap Different from Other Trading Platforms

Look, I'll be honest with you - the crypto bot space is crowded. Everyone and their dog is launching some AI-powered, blockchain-integrated, moon-promising trading platform. But Bitsgap takes a different approach. Instead of being an exchange itself, it connects to the exchanges you already use.

Here's what that actually means: your funds stay exactly where they are - in your Binance, Coinbase, or Kraken account. Bitsgap just executes trades on your behalf through secure API connections. It's like having a really smart friend who knows all the exchanges and can trade on all of them simultaneously, but your money never leaves your own accounts.

The platform supports over 15 major cryptocurrency exchanges, including the big names like Binance, Bybit, KuCoin, OKX, Kraken, and Coinbase. That's access to thousands of trading pairs, all managed from one clean interface. No more juggling between tabs and trying to remember which exchange has which coin.

## The Bot Arsenal: GRID, DCA, COMBO, and More

Bitsgap offers several bot types, each designed for different market conditions. Let me break them down in plain English:

**GRID Bot** is your sideways market specialist. When prices are bouncing around in a range (which, let's be real, happens a lot in crypto), the GRID bot places multiple buy and sell orders at different price levels. Every time the price moves up or down, it makes small profits. Think of it as catching pennies on every little wave.

**DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) Bot** is for the long-term thinkers. It buys fixed amounts at regular intervals, regardless of price. Market crashed? Great, you're buying low. Market pumped? You're still accumulating. It removes the emotional roller coaster from investing.

**COMBO Bot** is the futures trading beast. It combines DCA and GRID strategies and works with leverage. This one's for traders who understand futures and want to maximize returns in both bull and bear markets.

There's also the **BTD (Buy The Dip) Bot** which, as the name suggests, automatically buys when prices drop and sells when they recover. Perfect for volatile markets.

And the **LOOP Bot** that trades both base and quote currencies with automated reinvestments. It's designed to maximize compound returns.

## Real Performance: What Users Are Actually Saying

Let's talk real experiences, not marketing fluff. According to recent reviews from TrustPilot and Capterra, users report some interesting patterns.

Anne from the TrustPilot reviews mentioned that Bitsgap offers "enormous opportunity to earn money profitably on the crypto market" especially for those familiar with technical analysis. The platform's support for both long and short trading, combined with compound interest opportunities from the bots, creates genuine earning potential.

Mickey S., another verified user, emphasized the ease of use: "Bitsgap is very easy to use and does not demand any training to get started with." That's huge for beginners who find most crypto tools intimidating.

However, it's not all sunshine. Some users on Capterra noted that bots occasionally don't perform as expected, and there were complaints about auto-renewals. One reviewer mentioned, "Sometimes the bot of Bitsgap is unable to perform the process as per my expectation."

The reality? Bitsgap is a powerful tool, but it's not magic. You still need to understand basic trading principles and configure your bots properly. The 7-day free trial exists for exactly this reason - to test and learn before committing.

## AI Assistant: Your Trading Co-Pilot

One of the newer features that's getting attention is the AI Assistant. According to Bitsgap's data, users typically see a 20% increase in profits compared to manual trading when using the AI Assistant properly.

The AI analyzes market trends and historical data to suggest optimized strategies. It's not making decisions for you, but it's pointing out opportunities you might miss. Think of it as having a research analyst who never sleeps, constantly scanning markets and alerting you to potential plays.

The AI Assistant works across different exchanges and can help you personalize strategies based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. It's included in all paid plans, which is actually pretty generous considering some platforms charge extra for AI features.

## Pricing Breakdown: What You Actually Get

Here's where things get interesting. Bitsgap offers three paid tiers plus a free option, and honestly, the pricing is pretty transparent compared to competitors.

| Plan | Monthly Price | Annual Price (Save 20%) | GRID Bots | DCA Bots | Key Features |
|------|--------------|------------------------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **Free** | $0 | $0 | 0 | 0 | Manual trading, 3 COMBO bots on Evedex, 20 demo bots |
| **Basic** | $29 | $23/month ($276/year) | 3 | 10 | AI Assistant, unlimited smart orders, 30-day backtesting |
| **Advanced** | $69 | $55/month ($660/year) | 10 | 50 | Futures bots, trailing features, 180-day backtesting, profit reinvest |
| **Pro** | $149 | $119/month ($1,428/year) | 50 | 250 | Take profit features, AI Portfolio Mode, 365-day backtesting, priority support |

Every plan comes with a 👉 [7-day free trial](https://bitsgap.com) of the PRO features. No credit card required to start. That's actually a smart move on their part - it lets you test the advanced features before deciding if you need them.

## How to Actually Get Started (The Real Steps)

Creating an account takes about two minutes. You can sign up with email or use your Google/Facebook account. Once you're in, here's what you actually need to do:

**Step 1: Connect Your Exchange**
You'll create API keys on your exchange (Binance, Coinbase, whatever you use). Bitsgap walks you through this process. The important part: make sure you set the API to "read and trade" permissions only. Never give withdrawal permissions. Your funds should always stay in your exchange account.

**Step 2: Try Demo Mode First**
Seriously, use the demo mode. It mirrors real market conditions but with fake money. Test your bot strategies here. Most people skip this step and then complain when they lose money. Don't be most people.

**Step 3: Start Small**
Once you're comfortable, start with small amounts. The Basic plan lets you run up to 3 GRID bots and 10 DCA bots. That's plenty to test real strategies without risking your entire portfolio.

**Step 4: Monitor and Adjust**
Bots aren't set-it-and-forget-it (despite what some YouTubers claim). Check performance regularly. Pause bots that aren't working. Adjust parameters based on market conditions.

## Security: Where Your Money Actually Stays

This is crucial, so pay attention: Bitsgap doesn't hold your funds. Ever. 

Your crypto stays in your exchange accounts. Bitsgap only executes trades through encrypted API connections. The platform uses 2048-bit encryption, two-factor authentication, and has maintained a clean security record since 2017 - no hacks, no breaches.

Think of it this way: Bitsgap is like a really smart remote control for your trading accounts. It can press buttons and execute trades, but it can't withdraw your money. That's by design, and it's how it should be.

## The Trading Terminal: One Interface for Everything

Beyond bots, Bitsgap offers a unified trading terminal powered by TradingView. This means you get professional-grade charting tools, over 100 technical indicators, and the ability to execute trades across multiple exchanges without switching tabs.

The terminal supports various order types:
- Smart orders with take profit and stop loss
- Trailing orders that follow price movements
- TWAP orders for large positions
- Scaled orders for dollar-cost averaging

For active traders, this alone might justify the subscription. Managing positions across Binance, KuCoin, and Bybit simultaneously from one screen is genuinely useful.

## Promo Codes and Savings (2026 Edition)

While Bitsgap doesn't frequently release promo codes, there are a few ways to save:

**Annual Subscription Discount**: Pay yearly and automatically save 20% compared to monthly payments. That's $72 to $360 savings depending on your plan.

**Referral Program**: If you refer someone who subscribes, you get 30% of their payment as recurring commission. They get a 10% discount on their first order. Both sides win.

**7-Day Pro Trial**: This isn't exactly a discount, but getting full access to the $149/month Pro plan for a week at zero cost is essentially a $149 value. 👉 [Start your free trial here](https://bitsgap.com).

According to various coupon sites, some users have reported finding codes for 10-30% off, but these are typically limited-time offers tied to events like Black Friday. For instance, Bitsgap offered a 50% discount on annual Advanced and PRO plans during their 2025 Black Friday event.

## Mobile App: Trading On The Go

Bitsgap has both iOS and Android apps, updated as recently as January 2026. The apps let you monitor bot performance, execute manual trades, and make quick adjustments to your strategies.

However, based on user reviews, the mobile experience is more for monitoring and minor tweaks rather than full bot configuration. Most users prefer setting up bots on desktop and then monitoring via mobile. That's pretty standard for trading platforms.

One user noted: "Good for checking-in and making minor bot changes, but I still use the desktop/browser for full control."

## Exchange Support: Where Can You Actually Trade?

Bitsgap connects to 15+ exchanges, including:

**Major CEXs**: Binance, Coinbase Advanced, Kraken, KuCoin, OKX, Bybit, Gate.io, HTX, Bitfinex, Gemini, Poloniex, WhiteBIT, BitMart, Bitget

**DEXs**: Asterdex, EVEDEX (for decentralized futures trading)

The DEX integration is relatively new and interesting. EVEDEX offers non-custodial trading with no KYC requirements, combining decentralized transparency with centralized exchange speed. If you're into DeFi, this opens up additional opportunities.

## Limitations and Honest Drawbacks

Let's talk about what Bitsgap isn't perfect at:

**Not Available Everywhere**: Estonia residents can't use the trading functions (though they can browse the platform). Some regions have subscription limitations on the iOS app.

**Learning Curve Exists**: Despite claims of being beginner-friendly, there's still a learning curve. Understanding when to use GRID vs. DCA vs. COMBO bots requires some market knowledge.

**Bot Reliability Varies**: Some users report bots occasionally not executing trades as expected. This seems to happen more often during extreme volatility when exchanges themselves might have issues.

**Subscription Required for Most Features**: Unlike some competitors like Pionex that offer free bots, Bitsgap requires a paid subscription for most useful features. The free plan is very limited.

**Customer Support Can Be Slow**: While many reviewers praise the support team's knowledge, some mention slower response times during complex issues.

## Who Should Actually Use Bitsgap?

Based on everything I've researched, Bitsgap makes the most sense for:

**Intermediate to Advanced Traders**: People who understand trading concepts but want to automate execution and remove emotion from decisions.

**Multi-Exchange Traders**: If you're already trading on 2+ exchanges, managing everything from one interface is genuinely valuable.

**Strategy Testers**: The robust backtesting features (up to 365 days on Pro plan) let you validate strategies before risking real money.

**Passive Income Seekers**: Those willing to learn proper bot configuration and are okay with moderate, consistent returns rather than get-rich-quick schemes.

**Who Shouldn't Use It**:
- Complete crypto beginners who don't understand basic trading
- People expecting bots to magically generate profits without any effort
- Traders wanting complex custom indicators not available in the platform
- Those uncomfortable with API connections to exchanges

## Comparing to Alternatives: Bitsgap vs. 3Commas vs. Pionex

**Pionex** is free but requires you to hold funds on their exchange and charges 0.05% per trade. Bitsgap costs money but connects to your existing exchanges with their standard fees.

**3Commas** offers similar features but generally costs more ($22-$99/month) with similar bot limitations. Some users prefer 3Commas' interface; others find Bitsgap simpler.

**Cryptohopper** is another popular option but focuses more on social trading and strategy marketplace. Bitsgap keeps things more straightforward.

The choice often comes down to: Do you want to consolidate funds on a single platform (Pionex) or maintain control across multiple exchanges (Bitsgap)?

## Portfolio Tracking and Analytics

Beyond bots, Bitsgap provides comprehensive portfolio tracking across all connected exchanges. You can see your total holdings, profit/loss, allocation percentages, and historical performance - all in one dashboard.

The analytics include:
- Real-time portfolio valuation
- Performance metrics per bot
- Profit/loss tracking
- Historical backtesting results
- Market signals and anomaly detection

For traders managing positions across multiple platforms, having this consolidated view is surprisingly valuable. No more spreadsheet gymnastics to figure out your actual total position.

## The Bottom Line: Is Bitsgap Worth It?

Here's my take after diving deep into this platform: Bitsgap is a solid, legitimate tool for traders who want to automate strategies across multiple exchanges. It's not revolutionary, but it's reliable and well-built.

The 👉 [7-day Pro trial](https://bitsgap.com) is genuinely useful for testing whether the platform fits your needs. During that week, you can:
- Test bots with real or demo funds
- Access all Pro features including AI Assistant
- Backtest strategies across different timeframes
- Connect multiple exchanges and see if the unified interface clicks for you

If after the trial you're still unsure, the Basic plan at $23/month (annual) is reasonable for testing with real money. That gives you 3 GRID bots and 10 DCA bots - enough to run meaningful strategies without huge commitment.

The platform has been around since 2017, has a clean security record, and serves over 800,000 traders. That's not proof of perfection, but it's evidence of sustainability and trust.

Will it make you rich overnight? No. No bot will. But can it help you execute strategies more consistently, remove emotional trading decisions, and potentially improve returns? Based on the data and user experiences, yes - if you use it properly.
